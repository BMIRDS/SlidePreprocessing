# Slide Preprocessing Tools

This repository contains a set of slide preprocessing tools developed in our lab. The tools are designed to assist with the preparation and processing of presentation slides for various purposes. There are two main tools included in this repository:

- SlidePreprocessing: A general-purpose tool for various slide processing tasks.
- for_vit: A specialized tool for preprocessing slides related to Shuai's DPool library.

Both tools aim to streamline slide workflows. Refer to individual tool directories for instructions and usage guidelines.
